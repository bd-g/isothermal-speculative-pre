### Formatting Note

`(.*)test[0-9].c` files are duplicated in this directory for formatting purposes. Contents of each file match their counterparts in the `benchmarks` directory exactly - the only difference is the maximum column width on `.c` files in this directory is smaller to prevent overflow in the compiled LaTex file.
